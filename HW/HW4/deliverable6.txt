Deliverable 6

The decoder module uses shift register to make decoded lines.
If the enable is 1, the enable is shifted left according to the number of the address.
For example if the address is 5'b0000 the decoded output becomes 32'd1 and if the address is
5'b00001 the output becomes 32'd2 , 5'b00010 the output becomes 32'd4.
Like this the module makes the decoded output.
